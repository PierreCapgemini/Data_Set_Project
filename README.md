# Data_Set_Project

Once having pulled the remote repository, you will have the three data sets (.json, .db, .csv) joined with their respective python files. 
Each data set is divided in two parts : the function file and the tests file.

The .json data set (the first one) is going with FAO.py and test_fao.py.
The .csv data set (the second one) is going with WorldBank.py, and test_WorldBank.
Finally, the .db data set (the third one) is going with SQL.py and test_analyse.py.
 
Each function files has a suite of examples that allow you to check and see how they are working. 
The tests files are here to test each functions file.
